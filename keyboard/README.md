# Keyboard layouts

I base my 2 layouts on Portuguese Mac layout for both Windows and MacOS.

## PT+

PT (Mac) layout to be able to write portguese with a couple changes:

- `'` `?` -> `-` `_`
- `-` `_` -> `/` `?`
- `§` `±` -> `'` `` ` ``

- `Alt` + `-` -> `-`
- `Alt` + `Shift` +  `-` -> `_`

The  `´` `` ` `` and `~` `^` keys keep the *dead keys* behaviour as expected.

## PT-Dev

Everything that PT+ does, removes all dead keys, and:

- `º` `ª` -> `[` `{`
- `´` `` ` `` -> `]` `}`
- `ç` -> - `;`
- `Shift` + `ç` -> - `:`

- `Alt` + `º` -> `(`
- `Alt` + `´` -> `)`
- `Alt` + `ç` -> `ç`
- `Alt` + `Shift` + `ç` -> `Ç`
