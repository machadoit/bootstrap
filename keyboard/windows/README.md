# Installing Windows layout

## Specifics for Windows

At the moment only PT+ exists, as I have no need for PT-Dev on windows for now.

You need to **install** and **add the layout as input srouce**.
Optionally, if you like key placements and shortcuts Mac style (ex: CMD+C for copy) there are also instuctions for it.

## Install the layouts

On Windows you can install `.klc` files as keyboard layouts.

1. Install Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator (MSKLC) - https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=102134

1. TODO: Open the layout file; Make the bundle; Install it

## Add layout as input source

1. TODO

## [Optional] Add MacOS like shortcuts

1. Install AutoHotkey - https://www.autohotkey.com

1. Add a shortcut for the mac-win-shortcuts.ahk on your [startup](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/FAQ.htm#Startup).
> Press Win+R to open the Run dialog, then enter shell:startup to open the startup folder.

## [Optional] Swap Alt and Windows key location

1. TODO: If you don't have a keyboard with mac mode: Install the keymap thing; load the alt-win-swap.skl and save to registry
